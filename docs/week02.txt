Define Your Question / Problem Help Center

This task is simple. You've finished your exploratory analysis of the data and have a sense of what features are there and how they are related to each other. Now is the point where you want to identify a question or a problem that you are interested in addressing with the data. Write down that question in just 1 to 3 sentences so that another person who is as familiar with the dataset as you are would be able to understand and to assess.

As you develop your question, consider the following characteristics:

Is the question of interest to you?
Is there a particular audience (besides yourself) that might be interested in this question? Characterize that audience (i.e. teenagers living in New York, women living in Seattle, etc.)
Has the question already been addressed? Even if the question has been addressed, it might not have been done the way you would have done it. Researching previous attempts to answer this question may give you some insight into how you might approach the problem.
Is the question answerable from the data?
How specific is your question? Making a question more specific can often simplify your analysis quite a bit at the expense of possibly making the question less interesting. Balancing the specificity with the "interesting-ness" of your question is something you will have to figure out.
