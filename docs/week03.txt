Week 3 - Exploratory Modeling Help Center

At this point you need to dig into the data in order answer the question that you specified you wanted to answer. Here you'll need to think about the kinds of models that might be appropriate the answer your question. Are you asking an inferential question? A prediction question? Take care to match the modeling approach with the question type. Here are some things to think about.

Inferential or causal questions

What is your outcome? Do you have a key predictor that you want to correlate with your outcome?
What factors might confound or cloud any associations that you try to estimate or explore?
Are there any confounding factors for which you do not have measurements in your dataset? How can you deal with this?
How robust are your findings to small changes to the model?
Prediction questions

Have you split your data into appropriate training and test sets? Are the data adequate for doing this?
How good is the error rate of your prediction model? Can it be improved by changing algorithms?
Can you add any external data that might improve your predictions?
What types of features appear to be most important to prediction skill?
Are all types of prediction errors equally important in your problem?
Note that not all of these questions will be relevant to your problem so don't worry if you don't have answers to all of them. They are just questions to consider as you develop your model.
