Week 4 - Developing Final Model / Algorithm / Prediction Help Center

This task is all about finalizing your analysis so that you can best answer the question you developed earlier on in the project. Make sure that you can develop a coherent story or argument about your problem (you will ultimately need to write up a slide deck and a report).

You might want to consider the following as you finalize your analysis

Do you have an answer to your question? It's possible that you didn't answer the question completely, but see the next question.
Do you have a reasonable explanation for how your analysis addresses the question you posed? Can you come up with a theory or hypothesis that explains what is going on?
Is your work reproducible? Do you have all of the data and code needed for others to reproduce your work?
